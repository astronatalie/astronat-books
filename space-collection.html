                            <b><i>The Realm of the Nebulae (1936)</i></b> is the collation of Hubble's lectures on cosmology given as part of the Silliman Memorial 
                            Lectures at Yale University in 1936, outlining his discovery of universal expansion through factors such as redshift. These discoveries 
                            revolutionised our understanding of the universe, from how it began, to where it is today, to how it may end eventually.<br>
                            My first assignment in Year 10 science class with Mr Usmar was a video about how the expansion of the universe was discovered by Edwin 
                            Hubble through the observation of red-shifted galaxies. It was only logical then that I added <b><i>The Realm of the Nebulae (1936)</i></b> 
                            to my collection, with Hubble's work being a foundational part of my physics education and such a monumental piece of cosmological history. 
                            The only downside is that these 1st/1st copies are exclusively listed over $800, with a few multi-thousand copies floating around on 
                            AbeBooks too.<br>
                            I came close to buying a copy a few months back, as it was listed on eBay for only $170, but it wasn't in the best shape, and (as I was 
                            informed through a Reddit thread) was only the first UK printing - not a true 1st/1st. By sheer coincidence the other week, I got an email 
                            from eBay with suggested items related to that original listing, one of which was another copy for a similar price, but this one had the 
                            dark blue boards of the Yale University Press printing. Even now that I own it, I am sceptical of that listing - no way was that seller 
                            aware of what they had, considering the condition, the edition, and its pricetag being a fifth of the other listings on Abe (and an eigth 
                            of the price of another first UK printing, albeit with a dust jacket). The only cheaper copy was an ex-lib in terrible condition, and 
                            even then only by five pounds.<br>

                            <b><i>Life on Other Worlds (1940)</i></b> was one of the first books I added to my collection, coming from an unassuming bookstore in 
                            Mooloolaba, Queensland. Yes, I am the type to spend a beach holiday buying books.<br>
                            For one of the older books in my collection, it is in surprisingly great condition, largely due to it still having its original dust

                        <p>
                            Sir Patrick Moore's <b><i>The Amateur Astronomer (1957)</i></b> was my first "big" book purchase - before, I hadn't spent more than $30 on 
                            a single book, and even that was an outlier, with over half my collection coming about for free - but I couldn't help myself. This book is 
                            one of the most beautiful I own, with the hand-drawn moon map being my go-to justification when asked why I bother collecting these old 
                            things. Behind a fairly unassuming cover lies a great guide on amateur astronomy, including information on telescopes, solar system 
                            objects and cosmical phenomena. Being written by Moore, who was well known for his science education broadcast <i>The Sky At Night</i> on 
                            the BBC, the information provided is suitable for even the most novice stargazer, and remains relevant even close to seventy years after it 
                            was first published.<br>
                            Although I will never sell it, I take some satisfaction in knowing I own something so valuable - although my copy has some condition 
                            issues and an absent dust jacket, both of which lower the price, this book is scarce enough that I've seen it demanding upwards of $1000 
                            online. It also made me appreciate the value of 1st/1st volumes, as there is something about being able to hold a book and think "wow, I 
                            am holding the first instance of these words/ideas" - I feel incredibly lucky to own such a beautiful piece of history.

                            <b><i>Music of the Spheres (1961)</i></b> is the famous book an ex-boyfriend picked off the side of the road for my anniversary gift 
                            (believe it or not, the boards were once actually blue), but to give him credit, this is probably still my favourite book in my 
                            collection. When I sat down to take the photos for this website, I realised I had been sitting there flipping through the illustrations 
                            for half an hour while my camera ran out of battery beside me. It is absolutely mesmerising and the elloquence and artistry of Murchie is 
                            undeniable.<br>
