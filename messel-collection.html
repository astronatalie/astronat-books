                <h2>Harry Messel - Physicist and Educator</h2>
                Harry Messel was an Emeritus Professor at the University of Sydney. He was appointed Head of the School 
                of Physics in 1952, and established the Nuclear Research Foundation (now the Physics Foundation) in 
                1954, in order to raise funds to develop and support research in the School of Physics, raising more 
                than $130 million in his 35-year tenure for projects such as SILLIAC, the second computer in Australia, 
                and the International Science School alongside an integrated science syllabus in high schools.<br>
                <h2>The NRFSSS (now ISS)</h2>
                From its establishment in 1958 until 1962, the Nuclear Research Foundation Summer Science School was 
                targeted towards high school teachers, but was later opened to students from Australia and around the 
                world. Each year featured a line-up of international scientists from fields including atomic physics,
                astrophysics and space rocketry. Noteable guest speakers included astrophysicist Julius Sumner Miller,
                mathematician and cosmologist Hermann Bondi, and astronaut Alan Shepard.<br>
                The NRFSSS, now renamed the International Science School, still occurs on a bi-yearly basis, bringing 
                students together from around the world to hear about the latest research from leading academics and 
                scientists.<br>
                <h2>The Books</h2>
                Each year, the lectures presented at the ISS were compiled, printed and distributed to schools in order 
                to make the science they contained more accessible. My collection comprises those from 1960-1968 
                inclusive, all first editions/printings from Shakespeare Head Press. My goal is to compile the first 
                decade of publications (although the first two books, from 1958 and 1959 respectively, remain incredibly 
                scarce). These books, especially having been published in the years leading up to the Apollo Moon 
                landings, contain a wealth of information on the most "recent" scientific advances. I find it invaluable 
                to have the historical context behind what I study (Bachelor of Science, majoring in physics and data science) at 
                my fingertips, alongside the wisdom of one of the best science educators of the past century.

                            Subtitled as "<i>a course of lectures prepared for the Distinction Physics I class and the Nuclear Research Foundation Summer School for
                            Science Teachers</i>, Messel's <b><i>Lecture Notes on an Introductory Course in Modern Physics (1959)</i></b> is the second book published
                            as part of the NRFSSS. Comprising notes on topics surrounding atomic physics, this book is targeted towards first-year physics students at 
                            the University of Sydney.<br>
                            In the preface, Messel clearly outlines his intention to present the topics in a way that is "<i>tailored specifically for students 
                            following the New South Wales leaving certificate syllabus</i>", and allows for an appreciation of the connection between different
                            physical concepts, rather than just giving the bare facts and formulae.<br>
                            Messel also shares his dislike of students taking their own notes in lectures, as he believes "<i>it is highly probable that while he is
                            busy doing so, he misses the main points of the lectures</i>". This serves as his motivation for presenting the lectures in book-format,
                            to supplement the lectures the students will receive; he also argues it saves countless hours for the lecturer to write their lecture
                            notes once, rather than hundreds of students to write them each year.<br>
                            <br>
                            The first copy of this book I found was actually the second edition, published in 1963, left out for free by a professor clearing out his
                            office in the engineering building - although this copy is now on my "to sell" pile on the bottom of my bookcase, it was the first Messel
                            book I found (as seen through the selfie I took with it outside the Messel lecture theatre I spent my first year in). This first edition 
                            copy came from the Chancellor's Book Fair, and although in somewhat worse condition, this is one of my rarer* Messel books - not even Messel
                            himself had it in his collection!<br>
                            <br>
                            *Second only to the 1958 book, of which I've only known of three copies. At least Fisher Library loans books for a year at a time...

                            [About the authors]<br>
                            My boyfriend is my biggest supporter (read: enabler) of my book collecting hobby - he gifted me <b><i>A Journey Through Space and the Atom 
                            (1962)</i></b> for Christmas 2023, and I was absolutely thrilled (and proud that he'd listened to my rants on identifying first editions). 
                            I remember sitting on his bedroom floor, scanning the pages of early Apollo-era rocket designs, when I stumbled across the newspaper 
                            cutting being used as a bookmark. ATTENTION HOUSEWIVES! My poor boyfriend was mortified, having always been so supportive of my studies and
                            careers in STEM, but the final blow came when I read the page it was marking - "<i>The capsule is designed to carry three people. You can
                            see one man lying on his back. There is another man standing upright in the airlock. And - well - I don't see the third one; he is 
                            probably a woman and she's down in the pantry. After all, someone has to do the cooking for the crew.</i>". We both had a laugh over that 
                            one (you've got to laugh or else you'd cry) but wow, it really drove home the attitudes of the time. It was actually quite surprising, as 
                            the NRFSSS had quotas in place to ensure a (relatively) equal split of men and women in attendance, but then again, coming from non other 
                            than <i>Werner von Braun</i>, I should not have been surprised.

                            The lectures presented at the 11th International Science School, compiled within <b><i>Man in Inner and Outer Space (1968)</i></b>, are 
                            probably some of my favourite in my whole collection. The lecturers, including [WHO], encompass topics such as... 
                            <br>
                            For a long time, the only copies available online were ex-lib, and I was almost ready to dismiss it as as scarce as the 1958 book. But it 
                            was through a ViaLibri search, which returned a result from Hackenberg Booksellers in California, "signed by one of the authors". Getting 
                            in contact with the seller confirmed it was signed by Messel, and addressed to a "Chairman Miller" - a name I didn't immediately 
                            recognise, and nor did the seller based on the price I managed to get it for. But researching provenance is one of my favourite parts of 
                            collecting, and with the helpful note that the seller had acquired the book from a local Californian university...
                            <br>
                            Julius Sumner Miller was an American physicist and science educator, who worked at El Camino College in California, and made numerous 
                            visits to Australia throughout his career to contribute lectures to the International Science School. He was also the host of "Why Is It 
                            So?", a popular science show broadcast on the ABC, and the daily "Millergrams" published in newspapers to get the country thinking about 
                            science. <br>
                            To own a copy of such an incredible book, and to know that it was owned by such an incredible scientist and educator - as a scientist and 
                            educator myself, I look up to both Miller and Messel so much, and this is such a valuable addition to my collection.

                            I only know of three copies to exist - one is part of Messel's personal collection, one is part of Butler's personal collection, and the 
                            third is sitting on my shelf - under loan from Fisher Library. A few copies are available for purchase online, but they are the 1960 
                            edition published by Macmillan. I write this while lying in bed, with a perfect view of the SLMPSST-shaped gap on my Messel shelf, but 
                            after exhausting every second-hand book store in Sydney, my only hope seems to be sweet-talking the university into letting me buy it off 
                            the library - it's not like people are lining up to borrow it, it's been relegated to storage and came to me with a thick layer of dust. 
                            This is one of the very very rare occasions in which I will accept an ex-lib copy, as the book was only distributed to school libraries 
                            around the country, and I doubt many well-preserved copies still exist.

                            If you thought SLMPSST was hard to find... I was convinced this book didn't actually exist, as there is absolutely zero record of it online,
                            until I found a copy while admiring my boyfriend's aunt's collection (and nearly cried). I am not quite desperate enough to disrupt this 
                            copy's path down her bloodline, and thus need to find a second copy to have for myself, but everything appears to be stacked against me. 
                            There is no trace of A. J. Herz online, aside from a handful of papers. There is no trace of the book itself. The book it softcover, tiny, 
                            65 years old, and I'd be surprised if the print run was greater than a few hundred, meaning they're beyond scarce. To be completely honest, 
                            I don't hold out much hope for this one :(
