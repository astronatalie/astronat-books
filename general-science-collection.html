                            <b><i>Arithmetical Questions (Second, Enlarged Edition, 1795)</i></b> 
                            is the oldest book in my collection, and one of my absolute favourites - although 
                            maths isn't my main area of collection, this book is just such an amazing relic of 
                            the past.<br>
                            To begin with the book itself, before I even start on the content, the covers are 
                            beautifully marbled and still in quite great condition despite being 229 years old. 
                            The spine leather is a bit flaky, and the paper title is partially detached, but 
                            the wonderful people at Douglas Stewart Fine Books made sure to preserve it in a 
                            plastic cover, which I will definitely adopt for some of my other books. My 
                            favourite part about the aesthetics of this book, however, is the paper - the 
                            entire book is written on a pale eggshell blue paper, something I had never seen 
                            nor heard of before. All pages are clean, with the exception of some doodles 
                            written in fountain pen, including an entire question with a large X through it - 
                            I guess even 18th-century students got frustrated over their maths homework! 
                            Lastly, it wasn't until the turn of the 19th-century that the long s was phased out 
                            of typography, and thus trying to skim read the text gives one a headache:
                            <i>"By the folar fyftem is meant the order and difpofition of the feveral heavenly 
                                bodies [...] Thefe celeftial fpheres confift of planets and comets."</i>
                            Of course, I can't replicate the true text on my modern laptop, but the long s is 
                            near 
                            indistinguishable in print to the regular f. Imagine a word like selflessness - 
                            felfleffneff! <br>
                            Okay, now on to the actual content - this book contains a range of problems on a 
                            range of topics, from the Battle of Hastings, to Halley's Comet, to the price of 
                            stockings (something all women MUST know!). I was very surprised as to the attitude 
                            the author took towards the education of women; despite the views of the time, 
                            William Butler ("teacher of writing, accounts, and geography, in ladies schools, 
                            and in private families") states the education of women as being "eminently
                            conjucive to the welfare of a state". He does, however, go on to justify that claim 
                            by quoting "[women] are only competent to form men"... lovely. Although Butler was 
                            heavily in support for the education of women, he did so under the intent to 
                            provide young men with higher quality early education. But hey, it was a start!
