                        <h2>My Collection</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hi! My name is Natalie and I am a 21-year-old science student and educator from Sydney, Australia. I have been interested in collecting 
                            books since high school, where I fell in love with the 1980s Coroneos textbook my Year 11 maths teacher showed my class - something about 
                            the typewritten pages littered with hand-drawn diagrams was so much more appealing than the computer-designed textbooks I had for all my 
                            other subjects. The first book in my collection was a gift that an ex-boyfriend found on the side of the road - not the most glamourous 
                            origin story, but <i>Music of the Spheres</i> is still one of my favourites; again, the beautiful illustrations were what drew me in, and 
                            it was only after Murchie made reference to the hypothetical concept of having humans living in orbit that I was prompted to check the 
                            publication date. Since then, I've prioritised collecting books that are often overlooked by other collectors, forgotten pieces of history 
                            that I can preserve (and spend many hours making a website for!).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My collection currently comprises a couple dozen books on various STEM topics, predominantly astronomy, astrophysics, and the development of 
                            modern science, topics which supplement both my undergraduate studies and my work as a STEM educator. I find it invaluable to have access 
                            to the history of the modern concepts I hear about in my lectures, as I believe science is at its most valuable when we acknowledge how it 
                            has developed over time. To quote my 2023 entry to the Australian Young Book Collector's Prize:
                            <div class = "quotebox">
                                <i>
                                    "I collect books to preserve knowledge and use it to inform both myself and others. When my astrophysics homework leaves me lost, I 
                                    have hundreds of years of background information to set me on the right path. When my young students bombard me with “why” in response 
                                    to whatever answer I give them, I am prepared to take them on a journey through decades of technological advancement. When the world is 
                                    faced with uncertainty, I know I have the voices of thousands of academics, scientists, and researchers preserved in ink, and a voice 
                                    with which to share them."
